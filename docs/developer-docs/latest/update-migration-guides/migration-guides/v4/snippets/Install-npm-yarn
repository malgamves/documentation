Install the upgraded version:

<code-group>

<code-block title="NPM">
```sh
npm install
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="YARN">
```sh
yarn
```
</code-block>

</code-group>

::: tip
If the operation doesn't work, try removing your `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`. If that doesn't help, remove the `node_modules` folder as well and try again.
